# Autops

<br>

Autops is a Python/Django web application that helps automate IT infrastructure operations for teams.

Why the name Autops?

It is simply to signify <b>Automation</b> of <b>Operations</b> required by IT infrastructure teams. 

<h3>Project Backgroup</h3>

This project was started by me in 2015 as a personal side project in an attempt to learn Django web framework and combine a set of python scripts into a web app that IT operation teams could use to accomplish repetitive release management and sys admin tasks remotely, without logging in to Windows and Linux servers. Functionality can be easily extended if required since the design is object oriented.
